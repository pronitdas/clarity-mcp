To add a memory graph to your clarity-mcp server, you‚Äôre essentially giving your MCP agent persistent, structured memory that it can reference across interactions‚Äîthink of this as a contextual brain.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how to integrate a memory graph:

üß† 1. What is a Memory Graph?
A memory graph is:

A structured representation (usually a graph DB or in-memory object graph)

Nodes = entities, ideas, tasks

Edges = relationships (e.g., inspiredBy, solves, refines)

Useful for: long-term memory, context linking, progressive problem solving

üîß 2. High-Level Integration Strategy
‚úÖ Option A: Use an in-memory object graph (simple)
Store a JavaScript/TypeScript object tree

Good for prototyping, no DB needed

ts
Copy
Edit
const memoryGraph = {
  nodes: [],
  edges: []
};
Create a tool like storeMemory, linkMemory, recallMemory that manipulates this structure.

‚úÖ Option B: Use a graph database
Neo4j or SQLite with RDF-like triples

Store concepts and their relations

Use neo4j-driver (for TypeScript) or an ORM

Better for scaling and cross-session recall

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Define Tool Interfaces
Add MCP tools like:

addMemory
ts
Copy
Edit
export default {
  name: "addMemory",
  description: "Add a concept or observation to the memory graph.",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      node: { type: "string", description: "The concept or thought to add." }
    },
    required: ["node"]
  },
  run: async ({ node }) => {
    memoryGraph.nodes.push({ id: uuid(), label: node });
    return `Stored: ${node}`;
  }
}
linkMemory
ts
Copy
Edit
export default {
  name: "linkMemory",
  description: "Link two memory nodes with a relationship.",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      from: { type: "string" },
      to: { type: "string" },
      relation: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["from", "to", "relation"]
  },
  run: async ({ from, to, relation }) => {
    memoryGraph.edges.push({ from, to, relation });
    return `Linked ${from} -> ${relation} -> ${to}`;
  }
}
recallMemory
ts
Copy
Edit
export default {
  name: "recallMemory",
  description: "Query the memory graph for relevant nodes.",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      query: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["query"]
  },
  run: async ({ query }) => {
    const result = memoryGraph.nodes.filter(n => n.label.includes(query));
    return result;
  }
}
üß± 4. Optionally: Add Embeddings + Vector Search
Use OpenAI or local embeddings + annoy/hnswlib to:

Embed all memory nodes

Add a searchMemory tool that returns the most relevant concepts

üß™ 5. Register the Tools
In index.ts or server.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
import addMemory from './tools/addMemory';
import linkMemory from './tools/linkMemory';
import recallMemory from './tools/recallMemory';

const tools = [
  // previous tools...
  createTool(addMemory),
  createTool(linkMemory),
  createTool(recallMemory),
];
üß† Bonus: Use graphlib or d3-graph for Visualization
Plug your graph into a visualizer endpoint.

Use D3 or Cytoscape in a local dashboard for browsing your agent‚Äôs ‚Äúbrain.‚Äù

‚úÖ Summary
Task	Tool Name	Benefit
Add memory	addMemory	Records facts, thoughts, or steps
Link concepts	linkMemory	Shows cause-effect, hierarchy
Recall ideas	recallMemory	Retrieves info across sessions
(Optional) Vector Search	searchMemory	Matches semantic memory

Would you like me to:

Generate these tools as full .ts files?

Help integrate with a real backend like Neo4j or DuckDB?

Add a memory retention policy (e.g. expiration, priority)?

Let me know your stack choice (in-memory vs DB) and I‚Äôll give you a plug-and-play module.
